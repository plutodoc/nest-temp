# Intro

Nest (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).
